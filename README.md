# Repo_Warwick_internship
 Repository for my internship in Control and Fluid mechanics in the University of Warwick. Contains codes to solve 
and see the behaviour of the KS (Kuramoto-Sivashinsky) and Benney equation. 

The main file is one on Benney equation. There is 
- BDF_FD_Sp_eval file : File which contains verifications that the numerical schemes are well computed (asymtotics, linear regime, comparison between Spectral and Finite difference methods)
