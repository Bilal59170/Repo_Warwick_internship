Folder for the KS equation. 

This work was only an introduction to my project. It allowed me to make my first solver on a reduced-order model of the Navier-Stokes equation. 
I just observed the behaviour of the numerical solution while playing with the $\nu$ parameter, but I did not study it deeply. 
Two videos are available:
- One with $\nu=13/48$ until $T=100$ that shows the progressive wave behaviour of the solution
- The other with $\nu = 1/50$ until $T=10$ (after the numerical scheme diverges) where we can see some chaotic behaviour of the equation.
